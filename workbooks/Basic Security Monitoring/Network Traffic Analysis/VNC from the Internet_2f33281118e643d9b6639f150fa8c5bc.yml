path: /Basic Security Monitoring/Network Traffic Analysis
description: This rule detects network events that may indicate the use of VNC traffic
  from the Internet. VNC is commonly used by system administrators to remotely control
  a system for maintenance or to use shared resources. It should almost never be directly
  exposed to the Internet, as it is frequently targeted and exploited by threat actors
  as an initial access or back-door vector.
