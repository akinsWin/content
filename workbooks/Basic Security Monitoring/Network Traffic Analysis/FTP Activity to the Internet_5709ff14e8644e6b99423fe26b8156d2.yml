path: /Basic Security Monitoring/Network Traffic Analysis
description: This rule detects events that may indicate the use of FTP network connections
  to the Internet. The File Transfer Protocol (FTP) has been around in its current
  form since the 1980s. It can be a common and efficient procedure on your network
  to send and receive files. Because of this, adversaries will also often use this
  protocol to exfiltrate data from your network or download new tools. Additionally,
  FTP is a plain-text protocol which, if intercepted, may expose usernames and passwords.
  FTP activity involving servers subject to regulations or compliance standards may
  be unauthorized.
