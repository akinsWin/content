path: /Basic Security Monitoring/Network Traffic Analysis
description: This rule detects events that may describe network events of proxy use
  to the Internet. It includes popular HTTP proxy ports and SOCKS proxy ports. Typically,
  environments will use an internal IP address for a proxy server. It can also be
  used to circumvent network controls and detection mechanisms.
