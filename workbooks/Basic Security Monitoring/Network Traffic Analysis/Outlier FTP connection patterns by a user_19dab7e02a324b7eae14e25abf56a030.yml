  code: This detection rule attempts to find the outlier User from the SYSMON-NETWORK  stream
    based on their FTP connection activities.In this,  distinct system and distinct
    Destination IP having Destination port as 21     is captured  and compared with
    every other User in the last one week. This outlier detection rule, will help
    in nailing those outlier Users who show unusual FTP connection  pattern as compared
    to the other Users  behaviour.
