name: IPSEC NAT Traversal Port Activity
path: /Basic Security Monitoring/Network Traffic Analysis
description: This rule detects events that could be describing IPSEC NAT Traversal
  traffic. IPSEC is a VPN technology that allows one system to talk to another using
  encrypted tunnels. NAT Traversal enables these tunnels to communicate over the Internet
  where one of the sides is behind a NAT router gateway. This may be common on your
  network, but this technique is also used by threat actors to avoid detection.
