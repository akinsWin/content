path: /Basic Security Monitoring/Network Traffic Analysis
description: This rule detects network events that may indicate the use of Tor traffic
  to the Internet. Tor is a network protocol that sends traffic through a series of
  encrypted tunnels used to conceal a user's location and usage. Tor may be used by
  threat actors as an alternate communication pathway to conceal the actor's identity
  and avoid detection.
