name: SSH from the Internet
path: /Basic Security Monitoring/Network Traffic Analysis
description: This rule detects network events that may indicate the use of SSH traffic
  from the Internet. SSH is commonly used by system administrators to remotely control
  a system using the command line shell. If it is exposed to the Internet, it should
  be done with strong security controls as it is frequently targeted and exploited
  by threat actors as an initial access or back-door vector.
