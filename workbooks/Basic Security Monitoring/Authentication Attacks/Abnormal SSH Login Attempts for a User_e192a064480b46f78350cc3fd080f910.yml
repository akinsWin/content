  code: This detection rule attempts to find the outlier User from the AUTHENTICATION
    stream based on their SSH  login failure activities. In this, count of all SSH
    login failure events occured due to incorrect/bad password for a User having distinct
    public  Source IP,System  along with percentage of login failure events   is compared
    with every other user having distinct public Source IP, System   in last one hour.
    Here, the percentage of status failed is used to identify the ratio of unsuccessful
    login failure activity occured due to incorrect/bad password among other Users.
