  code: This detection rule attempts to find the outlier user from the IAM stream
    based on their account creation activities. In this, count of all account creation
    events along with percentage of creation events of a user are compared with every
    other user in last one week. Here The percentage of status passed is used to identify
    the ratio of successful creation activity among other users.
