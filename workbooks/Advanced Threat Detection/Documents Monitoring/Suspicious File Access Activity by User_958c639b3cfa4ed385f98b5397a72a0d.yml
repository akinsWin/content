  code: This detection rule attempts to find the outlier User from the DOCUMENTS stream
    based on their file access   activities. In this, count of all distinct file access
    events for a User having distinct Source IP along with the  percentage of file
    access events is compared with every other User having distinct Source IP and
    file in last one week. Here, The percentage of status passed  is used to identify
    the ratio of successful file access activity  among other Users.
