    based on their file download  activities. In this, count of all distinct file
    download events for a Source IP having distinct user along with the  percentage
    of file download events is compared with every other Source IP having distinct
    User and file in last one week. Here, The percentage of status passed  is used
    to identify the ratio of successful file download activity  among other Source
    IPs.
