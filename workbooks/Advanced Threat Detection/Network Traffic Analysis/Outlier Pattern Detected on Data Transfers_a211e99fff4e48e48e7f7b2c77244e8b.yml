  code: This detection rule attempts to find the outlier Source IP from the NTA-HTTP
    stream based on the data transfer activities. In this,  the sum of TXLen is calculated
    having  distinct Destination port, Destination IP  along with the  percentage
    of data transfer events is compared with every other User having distinct Destination
    IP and Destination port in last one week. Here, The percentage of status passed  is
    used to identify the ratio of successful data transfer activity  among other Users.
