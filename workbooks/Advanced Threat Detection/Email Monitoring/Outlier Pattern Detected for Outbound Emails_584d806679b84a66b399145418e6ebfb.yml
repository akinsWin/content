  code: This detection rule attempts to find the outlier Sender from the EMAIL-GATEWAY
    stream based on the outgoing email activities. In this, count of all recipients  having
    distinct  subject name for  outgoing email activities of a sender  is captured  by
    comparing with every other sender in last one week. This outlier detection rule,
    will help in nailing those outlier senders who show unusually high outgoing email
    activities as compared to the other senders  behaviour over the last  one week.
