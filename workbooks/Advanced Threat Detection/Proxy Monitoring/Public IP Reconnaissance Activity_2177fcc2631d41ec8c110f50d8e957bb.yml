description: Identifies domains commonly used by adversaries for post-exploitation
  IP reconnaissance. It is common for adversaries to test for Internet access and
  acquire their public IP address after they have gained access to a system. Among
  others, this has been observed in campaigns leveraging the information stealer,
  Trickbot.
