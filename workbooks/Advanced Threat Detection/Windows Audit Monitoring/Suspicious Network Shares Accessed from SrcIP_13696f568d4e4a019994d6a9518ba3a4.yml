    This detection rule attempts to find the outlier Source IP from the WIN-AUDIT
    stream based on their network share access activities.In this, count of all  Network
    Share Accessed events of a Source IP having distinct user,system and object  is
    captured by comparing with every other Source IP in last one week. This outlier
    detection rule, will help in nailing those outlier Source IP who show unusually
    high  network share access activities as compared to the other senders  behaviour.'
