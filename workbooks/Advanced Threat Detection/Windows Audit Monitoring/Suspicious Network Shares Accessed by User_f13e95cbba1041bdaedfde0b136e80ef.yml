    \ from the WIN-AUDIT stream based on their network share access activities.In\
    \ this, count of all  Network Share Accessed events of a User having distinct\
    \ system and object  is captured by comparing with every other User in the last\
    \ one week. This outlier detection rule, will help in nailing those outlier Users\
    \ who show unusually high  network share access activities as compared to the\
    \ other Users  behaviour."
